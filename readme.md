## Overview

Three different apps, covering cache, approval testing, and demonstrating mutation testing.

### 1 Cache - Weather Client

Imagine you are building an application that uses temperature data (maybe it is a news app, a holiday destination finder, or something similar). You have a library that can retrieve weather forecasts for you, but accssing this data can be slow. Your task is to build a local cache for this data to be used by your application, so that data can be returned more quickly - we assume that the weather doesn't change that often.
